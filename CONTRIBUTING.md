## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the [Contributor Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to [shaswat_kumar87@optum.com][email] or [shobhit.vijaivergia@optum.com][email].

## How to Contribute

How you write this is up to you, but some things you may want to include:

-   If tests are required for contributions, let them know, and explain how to run the tests
-   If you use anything other than GitHub to manage issues (ex. Rally, Jira), let them know which tools theyâ€™ll need to contribute
-   Consider explaining what contributions you are looking for an what contributions you are NOT looking for(if any).
-   Consider adding a link (or links) to a resource for people who have never contributed to InnerSource (or open source) before. Here are a couple of friendly tutorials you can include: http://makeapullrequest.com/ and http://www.firsttimersonly.com/

Example guideline for a forking approach for contributions

> 1.  Create your own fork of the code
> 2.  Do the changes in your fork
> 3.  Create pull request
>     -   Be sure you have followed the [code style](#styleguides) for the project.
>     -   Use descriptive Pull Request (PR) names
>     -   If your PR is a Work in Progress (WIP) then prefix the title with "WIP-{descriptive feature name}
> 4.  A lot of times, making a PR adhere to the standards above can be difficult. If the maintainers notice anything that we'd like changed, we'll ask you to edit your PR before we merge it. There's no need to open a new PR, just edit the existing one.
